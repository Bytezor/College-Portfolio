<h1> Homework 3 - Mr. Smiley Goes for a Scroll </h1>
<main><a href="Mr Smiley.html">Link to project</a><br>
    Collaborators: none<br>
    Components incompleted: N/A<br><br>
    Problematic code: when doing console log to track the values of the stars they seem to sometimes increment incorrectly by a very small amount (in the 0.00000001 type of range), while I believe it's an unnoticable error it might cause issues if run long enough<br><br>
    Special considerations: compared to the space invaders this project a lot more easy and fun for me to work on, I might go back and implement the extra credit ideas you had outlined<br><br>
