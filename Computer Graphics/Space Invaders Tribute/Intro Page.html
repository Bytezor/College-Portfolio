<h1> Homework 2 - Space Invader Tribute </h1>
<main><a href="Space Invaders Tribute.html">Link to game</a><br>
    Collaborators: none<br>
    Components incompleted: alien animation frames, aliens destroying barriers by contact finnicky<br><br>
    Problematic code: in a combination of anxiousness of having everything completed and lack of experience with javascript I feel plenty of handlers are unoptimized<br><br>
    Special considerations: when grading if you could give any feedback on how to make my code cleaner and more functional please do, I sometimes brute force a solution that then becomes too time consuming to revamp<br><br>
    In the old_script folder are a few modified versions of the js files that were copies made when reworking a system to ensure I had a back-up if it didn't work
